# Weird Gloop year-in-review

This is a proof of concept for a year-in-review of the wikis on the [Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org) network. You can view it live [here](https://iiii-i-i-i.github.io/year-in-review/).

The intent is to create something like [Forum:Weird Gloop week 2 update](https://meta.weirdgloop.org/w/Forum:Weird_Gloop_week_2_update), except formatted in a reader-friendly way and maybe with more interesting stuff for non-editors with nice colors and shit. Some ideas for what it could contain:

### Traffic stats

- [x] percent growth (make a nice graph) - [annotate big increases/decreases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_traffic_jumps)
- [x] traffic recovery vs old wikia site
- [ ] visits by country, new country visits

### Most popular pages of the year
- [x] split into rsw and osrsw
